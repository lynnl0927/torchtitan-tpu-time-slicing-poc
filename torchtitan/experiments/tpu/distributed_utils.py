  #   vars globally since we have a global view and `torchrun` does not
  #   support per-process env vars.
  # - Borg: Initialization must be called from the host process before worker
  #   processes begin. This is because ports need to be fixed beforehand,
  #   requiring external orchestration (e.g., via XManager) at the host level.
