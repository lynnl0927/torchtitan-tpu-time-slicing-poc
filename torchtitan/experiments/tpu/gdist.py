  """A programmatic API to `torchrun`, used to spawn `n` copies of `fn`.

  Here `fn` is the main entrypoint function to your PyTorch [distributed]
  program and `n = nnodes * nproc_per_node` [world_size].

  `torchrun` (https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/elastic/run.html) is the default
  launcher tool to start the worker processes when using distributed PyTorch.
  For those familiar with MPI, this is akin to `mpirun`.

  Use from the main program to spawn `nproc_per_node` copies of `fn` where
  `fn` is the main function of your PyTorch program. For multi-machine jobs,
  the main process on each machine should invoke `torchrun`. Effectively
  this runs `nnodes x nproc_per_node` copies of `fn`.

  Args:
    fn: The main function for the user training script.
    nnodes: The number of machines the job is running on. If not specified, it
      will infer the current Borg job's num tasks and in Colab it will default
      to 1.
    nproc_per_node: The number of local ranks to spawn. Defaults to the number
      of CUDA devices on the machine or 1 is no CUDA devices are found.

  Returns:
    A wrapped `fn` that can be called with the same args as `fn`
    but will launch multiple copies of `fn` and returns a dict
    of `{local_rank: fn()_on_local_rank}`.
